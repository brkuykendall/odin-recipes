    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This homemade pumpkin pie made with mashed, cooked pumpkin is my family's
      favorite. Skip the canned pumpkin and store-bought crust and make your
      holiday pumpkin pie from scratch with a flaky homemade pastry crust and a
      deliciously spiced pumpkin filling. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family
      does!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup shortening</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
      <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in
        shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
        Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough
        to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a
        lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie
        pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough
        1 1/2 inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps
        and set pie pan aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it
        right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of
        the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs,
        cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric
        mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1
        inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges
        with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
